## Hi there 👋



- 📖 Education: Platov South Russian State Polytechnic University (NPI) 
      Specialty: Software Engineering.
- 💻  Work experience: Developed a website for the educational organization ChATC (chatc.ru) from scratch - from design to layout and integration with CMS WordPress. In the process, I implemented adaptive design, ensuring correct display on different devices. The site was optimized for improved page loading, which improved user experience.
On freelancing I was engaged in layout of various websites, where I successfully applied modern HTML, CSS and JavaScript technologies to create interactive and dynamic pages.
I also developed a script to automate the schedule in the “Rector-College” program. This script allowed to significantly reduce the time of preparing the timetable for printing, automating routine processes and increasing the productivity of administrative staff.
